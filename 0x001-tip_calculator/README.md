# Tip Calculator
### Welcome to the Tip Calculator!
This Python script helps you calculate the amount each person should pay, including a tip, based on the total bill and the number of people splitting the bill.

## How to Use
1. Ensure you have Python3 installed on your machine.

2. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.

3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

```

4. Run the script.

python tip_calculator.py
```

5. Follow the prompts to enter the total bill amount, the percentage tip you'd like to give (10, 12, or 15), and the number of people splitting the bill.  
The script will then calculate the total amount each person should pay, including the tip, and display the result.

Example
```
~ What was the total bill? $100
~ What percentage tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
